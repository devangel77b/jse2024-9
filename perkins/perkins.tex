\begin{abstract}
T\&M Associates is a national engineering firm headquartered in Middletown, New Jersey that specializes in many different fields of engineering. Throughout the past semester, I have had the opportunity to collaborate with Mechanical, Electrical, and Plumbing (MEP) engineers at T\&M, working on computer-aided design (CAD) drawings of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. These drawings play a crucial role in the construction process, guiding contractors through the installation of the HVAC systems of a building.
