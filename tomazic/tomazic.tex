\begin{abstract}
Naval architecture is the study of ship design, focusing on overall balanced design considering the functional requirements, with special focus on the hull, including buoyancy; centers, moments, and stability; structural integrity; resistance and powering, etc. I examined the design of a small \qty{1}{\meter} LOA hull intended for a model or autonomous sailing craft. To design the hull and obtain volumes and centers for stability calculations, I used Autodesk Fusion. To physically construct the hull, I used additive manufacturing (3D printing), using several hull sections in order to satisfy manufacturability constraints due to bed length of the tooling.
