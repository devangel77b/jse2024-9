\begin{abstract}
In order to work efficiently, employees need to be able to access information regarding different products quickly and easily. During our internship at Commvault, we worked on optimizing the Update Center which employees use to access information regarding various Commvault files and specific updates regarding these files. The information includes an update summary of all changes made, all bugs found, and all bugs fixed. We created a page where employees can input the specific form and update that they want information on, then have that information extracted using SQL and sent to a generative AI to create a summary and 20 unique test cases for the data for the user to use, as well as the ability to compare the differences between two or more specific updates.
