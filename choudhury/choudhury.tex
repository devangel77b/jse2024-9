\begin{abstract}
I worked with the bridge and traffic safety department of Monmouth County Engineering. My primary goal was to learn more about county engineering and surveying. I worked on several bridges, taking quantity take-offs (cost estimates), analyzing topography changes (how much the bridge elevation has changed in the past few years), and creating sketches for important elements of certain bridges in an effort to learn more about governmental civil engineering and bridge creation and maintenance.
